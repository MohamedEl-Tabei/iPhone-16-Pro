        <p class="col-span-5">iPhone 16 Pro takes video capture to a whole new level with <strong>4K 120 fps Dolby
                Vision</strong> — our
            highest resolution and frame rate combo yet. Enabled by the new 48MP Fusion camera with second-generation
            quad-pixel sensor and our powerful A18 Pro chip, iPhone 16 Pro lets you record 4K 120 fps Dolby Vision in
            video mode or slo-mo.

            And now you can <strong>adjust the playback speed after capture</strong> in the redesigned Photos app,
            giving you greater
            editing capabilities. To add a dreamy quality to your shot, try out the new half-speed option. Or for a
            cinematic effect, slow it right down to 24 fps playback.

            iPhone 16 Pro also provides <strong>a big leap in audio performance</strong> with four studio-quality mics
            for higher-quality
            recording. They provide a lower noise floor so you get more true-to-life sounds. New Spatial Audio capture
            makes your videos sound more immersive when listening with AirPods. And thanks to wind noise reduction, the
            audio quality is even clearer.

    <p class="w-1/2 mt-20 text-center m-auto">Powered by advanced intelligence and Spatial Audio capture, Audio Mix lets
        you
        <strong> adjust the way voices sound in
            your videos</strong> using three different voice options. Want to decrease background sound? Or just focus
        on the
        voices
        that are in frame? Simply select the mix and adjust intensity to get the sound you want after video capture.

            Only captures the voices of the people on camera, even if people off-camera are talking
            during the recording.

            Makes voices sound like you’re recording in a professional studio equipped with sound-dampening walls. Great
            for vloggers or podcasters because the recording will sound like the mic is close to the subject’s mouth,
            even if it’s a few feet away.

            Captures all of the voices around you and consolidates them toward the front of the screen — just like sound
            is formatted for the movies.
