    <p class="col-span-4">iPhone 16 Pro features a Grade 5 titanium design with a new, refined microblasted finish.
      Titanium has one of the
      highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making these models <strong>incredibly strong and impressively
        light.</strong>
      iPhone 16 Pro comes in four stunning colors — including new Desert Titanium.

      Internal design improvements — including a 100 percent recycled aluminum thermal substructure and back glass
      optimizations that further dissipate heat — enable up to 20 percent better<strong> sustained performance</strong>
      than iPhone 15
      Pro. So you can do all the things you love — like high-intensity gaming — for longer.
